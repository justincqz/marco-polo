Marco po.io is a travel planner that aims to help in optimizing the process that goes into planning any holiday.

Friends and family often use a plethora of resources to plan their holidays, from sourcing their transport options to scouting for potential attractions at a destination. As a result, planning becomes complex and confusing, with people often finding difficulty in agreeing on what, where, and when to fly, what to see and do.

Once the travel itinerary is completed, a unique hash code can be generated to share with your friends. Your friends can then view the itinerary that you have planned, and vote for their preferred choices.
